## Getting Started
You'll need an ESP8266-NodeMCU, and OLED Screen (I used the 128x64) 4 female/female jumper cables, USB cable for power and data to ESP8266.

The attacked .ino file will get you up and running. The provided data_display_oled.jpg file shows how the data will be displayed on the OLED.

Good Luck...
